What is an Automatic Car?
automatic car is an automobile with an automatic transmission that doesn't require a driver to shift gears manually. Transmissions, also known as gearboxes, help to direct the rotational force and speed of a car. Therefore, automatic transmissions switch gear ratios as the vehicle moves. An automatic transmission uses sensors that allow it to shift gears at the appropriate time by using the internal oil pressure. Shifting gears happens when the transmission is disconnected from the engine temporarily, which is handled by the torque converter.

Our Algorithim Description: 

- we use a reference path and dynamic list of obstacles to generate alternative
 trajectories for an ego vehicle.
 
- The ego vehicle navigates through traffic defined in a provided driving scenario
- we define the properties for each vehicle we are willing to use, such as color, speed and the points
  that the vehicle will go across. 
- When our simulation starts the vehicles start moving and collecting data from its environment 
  thus reacting accordingly.
