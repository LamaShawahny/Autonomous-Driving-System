What is an Automatic Car?
automatic car is an automobile with an automatic transmission that doesn't require a driver to shift gears manually. Transmissions, also known as gearboxes, help to direct the rotational force and speed of a car. Therefore, automatic transmissions switch gear ratios as the vehicle moves. An automatic transmission uses sensors that allow it to shift gears at the appropriate time by using the internal oil pressure. Shifting gears happens when the transmission is disconnected from the engine temporarily, which is handled by the torque converter.


Our Algorithim Description: 

1) In our algorithm we designed the path by providing it with points that determine our road sides.

2) after that we define the properties for each vehicle we are willing to use, such as color, speed and the points that the vehicle 
will go across. 

3) When our simulation starts the vehicles start moving and collecting data from its environment 
thus reacting accordingly.
