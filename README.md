# Autonomous-Driving-System
Our Algorithim Description: 

1) In our algorithm we designed the path by providing it with points that determine our road sides.

2) after that we define the properties for each vehicle we are willing to use, such as color, speed and the points that the vehicle 
will go across. 

3) When our simulation starts the vehicles start moving and collecting data from its environment 
thus reacting accordingly.
